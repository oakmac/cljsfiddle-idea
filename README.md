# cljsfiddle.com design idea

## Notes

* use Open Sans and Droid Sans Mono for type
* make header clearer / more explicit
* separate header, body, and footer with visual contrast
* consolidate examples into a dropdown to save space and reduce actionable
  targets on the page
* put action buttons closer to their target locations (Run, Save, Clear)
* only one primary action button on the page, others secondary
* move "made by" and GitLab links to footer and put into a sentence
